# PokeChecker interactive shiny app.

Pokechecker enables you to check your PokéDex regarding special forms, males, females, three-star rated, shadow and purified Pokémon. It is based on a Google Sheet, which needs to be kept up-to-date because Niantic has not allowed to use any API to access your data automatically.

Currently, the page is reachable on [my Posit Shiny server](https://peter-t-ruehr.shinyapps.io/PokeChecker/).

Issues can be reported at [PokePecker's Issues page](https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/PokeChecker/issues), where comments and ideas are also welcome. Enjoy!
